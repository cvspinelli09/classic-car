racing team in 1950, Carlo Abarth's company expanded into producing tuning equipment and engines for various Fiats alongside its own racing models. Such was the cachet of the name that Fiat was glad to have its products branded with the Abarth badge. Its best-known and arguably most fun creations were the tiny and giant-killing Fiat 500 and 600 - based models. After a flirtation with Simca, Abarth was taken over by Fiat in 1971 and continued to denote performance models, although it became little more than a trim level during the 1990s and 2000s.
